        <h1>PL/SQL</h1>
        <p>PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed specifically for managing relational databases. 
            It is an extension of SQL that includes procedural language elements, such as loops, conditional statements, and subroutines. 
            PL/SQL is used to create stored procedures, functions, and triggers in Oracle Database.

            PL/SQL allows developers to write complex database applications, including data manipulation, data analysis, and transaction control, all within the database environment. 
            This helps to improve performance and reduce network traffic by reducing the number of database calls needed to execute an application.
            
            PL/SQL is often used for data-centric applications and is commonly used in the development of enterprise-level applications, including financial systems, supply chain management systems, and customer relationship management systems.

        <h2>PL/SQL program structure consists of a few basic elements:</h2>
        <br>
        <li>DECLARE - This is the optional declaration section where you declare any variables, cursors, or other program objects that you will use in the program.</li>
        <li>BEGIN - This is the required execution section where the actual program logic is placed.</li>
        <li>EXCEPTION - This is an optional exception handling section that handles any runtime errors that may occur during the program execution.</li>
        <li>END - This is the end of the PL/SQL block.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Programs of PL/SQL: </h2>
