	<h1>What is SQL? </h1>
	<p>Structured Query Language is a computer language that we use to interact with a relational database.
		SQL is a tool for organizing, managing, and retrieving archived data from a computer database. The original name was given by IBM as Structured English Query Language, abbreviated by the acronym SEQUEL. When data needs to be retrieved from a database, SQL is used to make the request. The DBMS processes the SQL query retrieves the requested data and returns it to us.
		Rather, SQL statements describe how a collection of data should be organized or what data should be extracted or added to the database.</p>
	<section>
		In SQL, there are three main types of statements: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).
<dl>
<dt>1. Data Definition Language (DDL):</dt>
<dd>
DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. Common DDL statements include:

CREATE: creates a new database object such as a table, view, index, or constraint.
ALTER: modifies the structure of an existing database object.
DROP: deletes an existing database object.
TRUNCATE: removes all data from a table.
</dd>
<dt>2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):</dt>
<dd>
DML statements are used to manipulate data within the database objects. Common DML statements include:

SELECT: retrieves data from one or more tables.
INSERT: inserts new rows into a table.
UPDATE: modifies existing rows in a table.
DELETE: removes rows from a table.
</dd>
<dt>3. Data Control Language (DCL):</dt>
<dd>
DCL statements are used to control access to the database and its objects. Common DCL statements include:

GRANT: gives a user or group of users access to database objects.
REVOKE: removes access from a user or group of users.
</dd>

<dt>4. Other common SQL statements include:</dt>
<dd>
WHERE: filters rows based on a specified condition.
GROUP BY: groups rows by one or more columns.
HAVING: filters groups based on a specified condition.
ORDER BY: sorts the rows based on one or more columns.
JOIN: combines data from two or more tables based on a related column.
</dd>

</dl>

	<dl>
	<dt>1. CREATE a Table:</dt>
	<p>Create command is used to create the structre of table and specify the variables of the table. </p>
	<dd><pre><code>
	CREATE TABLE employees (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50),
	last_name VARCHAR(50),
  	department VARCHAR(50),
  	salary DECIMAL(10,2)
	);
		</pre></code></dd>
		<dt>2. INSERT data in Table: </dt>
		<p>This command is used to insert the data in the structure of table.</p>
		<dd><pre>
		<code>
INSERT INTO employees (id, first_name,last_name, department, salary)VALUES
  (1, 'John','Smith', 'Sales', 50000.00),
  (2, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'Marketing', 60000.00),
  (3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'HR', 55000.00);
		</code>
		</pre>
		</dd>
		<dt>3. DISPLAY the data in table: </dt>
		<p>This command is used to display table.</p>
		<dd>
		<pre>
		<code>
		SELECT * FROM employees;
		
		</code>
		</pre>
